# **CS 225 Data Structures - Final Project Contract**
Team Contract (tianxin8-ebaadss2-aaronyu3-xoliva2) Communication 

1. Team Meetings Our team will meet once a week every Tuesday from 3-5 PM using Zoom. ebaadss2 is the designated note-taker. Notes will be stored on a Google document, time-stamped for each meeting. Each week, one member will draft the weekly DEVELOPMENT LOG entry, which is approved by the team at the start of the following week’s meeting. The rotation will start with ebaadss2. 

2. The team will engage in an additional weekly check-in over the weekend. Simple text over DIscord updates are acceptable.

3. Assistance Each team member can be contacted through email or Discord. Outside of emergencies or other commitments, we commit to responding to emails within 24 hours.

4. Respect The note-taker will also serve as the ‘project lead’ for the weekly meeting. Their role is to ensure that every member of the group has had a chance to speak or state their opinion about a design decision or any other topic related to the final project. All decisions will be accepted by simple majority – while unanimous agreement is preferred, it is not required. By signing this document, each member of the team commits to adhering to the decisions made, even if they personally disagree with them. 
# **Collaboration** 
1. Work Distribution Each week, the necessary delivarables for the week will be determined by the full team and each member will volunteer to work on one or more deliverables. When no one volunteers, two team members will be randomly assigned to work on the task as a paired-programming team. If this leads to an unbalanced workload for the week, adjustments can be made on a case by case basis.

2. Members can opt for minor or no responsibilities during a given week as long as written documentation is taken which he or she promises to undertake a larger responsibility in a proceeding week.


# **Time Commitment**
To ensure an equal distribution of work, each member is expected to independently work no less than two and no more than six hours per week on the project. If a deliverable ends up taking more time, the rest of the team should be pulled in to assist with the unforeseen complication, with each member taking an equal share of the workload or programming in pairs. It is the team’s responsibility, not the individual’s responsibility, to make sure a weekly deliverable is finished by the end of the week. 
However if a team member is habitually not completing their tasks, they may be asked – politely – to explain their circumstances. Based on their explanation further actions, such as alerting a staff member, may be taken on a case by case basis decided by the other team members. 

# **Conflict Resolution** 
Though conflict resolution via Smash Bros. would be fun, all real disputes between members will be dealt with in-group. If outside assistance is needed, we will be petitioning our mentor to make a judgement on our behalf.
If this was an MD file, each of us would sign our names here at the bottom with an electronic signature and a separate github commit over the same document.
